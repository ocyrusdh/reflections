How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it a lot easier to find the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If there was ever an issue with some new code, we could quickly role back to
    a previous woking version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pro is that you can control the creation of versions of your code at logical states.
    The con is that you must remember to commit your changes or they won't be saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
